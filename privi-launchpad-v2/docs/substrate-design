# Launchpool contract

The launchpool contract may be used by projects looking for funding. It resembles an ICO, with the ability to purchase 
options on the token after project completion.

A fundraise goes through 3 states:

### Fundraising rounds

Users may purchase launch tokens directly. Every fundraising round, the price of the launchtokens increases by a given
amount, ensuring that early investors obtain a better deal since they are taking an increased risk. The price of the 
launch tokens can be configured by the fundraisers. Funds raised are sent directly to the founders' wallet. 

### Launch

After the rounds are completed, launch tokens are exchanged for newly minted app tokens, which are the actual tokens 
associated with the project. Ownership of the app tokens is then transferred to the launched contract. 

### Expiration

After either a set amount of time, or when the fundraising time calls the expiration function, all ranging tokens are 
exchanged for app tokens held by the contract. App tokens are minted to fund the contract rewards. After the transfer is 
completed, ranging tokens are paused.

## Taxation

Substrate cannot charge a taxation on a specific account for all functionalities. We can however extend erc20 to add a 
taxation parameter there. I think however, that it would be better to let the launched contract handle taxation, and 
have the launchpool only distribute received funds over the investors, akin to how pods handle that.
